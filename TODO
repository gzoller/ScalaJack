Path to Performance
-------------------



[ ] - Create def() for each class (and maybe each collection?) found, to output json as seamlessly as possible

    -- Possibly a multi-pass generation?  Once to identify all the classes and generate def fn names, and another
       to actually generate the code in dependency order

[*] - Create JsonOutput (like Jsoniter's JsonWriter, but the name conflicts w/mine).  Initially continue to use
      StringBuilder, but use some of Jsoniter's clever ',' handling

[ ] - Explore dark magic Jsoniter mechanisms for all that bitwise/byte stuff to drive extreme efficiency

[*] - In scala-reflection, explode PrimitiveRTypeRef into separate Refs, like they have for primitive RTypes
