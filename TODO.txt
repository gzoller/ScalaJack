Path to Performance
-------------------

[ ] - Fix string value in JsonOutput to handle escaping " and anything else--maybe use apache library 

[ ] - Study Jsoniter and how it propagates its write config between compile-time and run-time (usage too)
      Ideally we'd love to be able to see cfg at compile-time and geneate accordingly.... Right now,
      ScalaJack's config is purely runtime, which is less convenient for us...
